Subject: Scaling ML Infrastructure at [Company]

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] is expanding its ML team, and your recent blog post about distributed training caught my attention. Having built similar systems at [Previous Company] that reduced training time by 60%, I'd love to explore how my experience could help scale your infrastructure.

At [Previous Company], I led the migration of our ML pipeline to Kubernetes, enabling the team to deploy 3x more models while cutting costs by 40%. I also implemented automated model monitoring that caught production issues 2 hours faster on average.

What excites me about [Company] is your approach to [specific company value/tech]. I've been following your work on [specific project] and see strong parallels with challenges I've solved.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call next week to discuss how I could contribute to your ML infrastructure goals?

Best regards,
[Name]
